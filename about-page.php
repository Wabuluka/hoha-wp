                <p>
                Hands of Hope Africa was founded in 2019 by Namara Jane a young Ugandan woman who saw an opportunity to have a positive impact on the 
                lives of those from underserved, marginalized and vulnerable backgrounds similar to hers.
                </p>
                <p>
                “I grew up from a typical Ugandan family of 9 children and I was told that our parents didn’t have enough
                 money to meet all our need. So, every child had to find their own way they needed. At the age of 5 years, I
                  moved to the streets as my siblings minded their own business, until after some time when I was lucky enough and a certain woman picked me
                 from the streets, nurtured me, educated me and loved me like her very own children.
                </p>
                <p>
                Went to the university and graduated with bachelors in accounting and finance. 
                I was told that my mum was given in marriage at an early age of 15 and never had a chance to go to school. 
                This still happens in my village and many others like that.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                So, after my studies I decided to help young girls like me especially the orphans and those on the streets as
                 a passion and also as a way of giving back to the community hence the establishment of hands of hope Africa in 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                If a parent doesn’t have enough money to pat school fees for all their children, they usually choose to educate the boys. 
                And so, girls are often given out in marriage at tender ages. Alternatively, in order to help with house hold expenses and pay fees for a few of their siblings,
                 children are expected to work at jobs such as selling fruits and vegetables and working as maids This is honest work but causes these children to miss out on their own 
                 education and opportunities it brings.
                </p>
